              Web Based (works on all PCs):<br>
              1) Press login button <br>
              2) Login with google (manual password managment under construction)<br>
              3) Visit "Web Tracker" page<br>
              4) Log focus sessions with shortcut<br>
              5) Visit dashbaord for data visualization<br>
              <br>

              <br>
              The Web has many built-in security measures. One of these is the inability
              for your browser to track keystrokes when not "clicked in" the current tab.
              This downloadable application is a way to get arround that. It will toggle
              between focused and not focused based on the keystroke, no matter what you're doing.
              It even works without the website open!

              <br>
              1) Click blue download button<br>
              2) Download Build file<br>
              3) Extract the files and run the main.exe file inside of the exe.win folder<br>
              *may have to bypass windows "potentiolly dangerous" warning. If that scares you....
              just use the web based tracker.... I won't get mad.... I think :)<br>

            <h2 class="mb-4">Why?</h2>
            <p>
              Learn How You Work was inspired by many sources, my own procrastination being the one of the main driving forces.
              I wanted to create a tool that would help me understand how I work, and how I can work better.
              I hear myself and others say "Oh I literally studied all day" or "I'm too busy, I'm just working all the time."
              Personally I doubt it. My solution was to create this tool to actually gather information about how much
              actual focused work is being done. The goal is to work efficiently, allowing time for other things in life....like Joes.

            <h2 class="mb-4">Design Choices (Don't even get me started)</h2>
            <p>
              This will be a Q&A style section as many people have actually qustioned why I did things the way I did them.... all {{ total_users }} people
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">Q1: Why do you have to manually input the focus sessions, woulden't it make more sense for a program to track if you're producive</h2>
            <p>
              Ahh geeze. This one opens up a big can of worms. Yes, intuitivley it would make sense for a program to detect if your producive or not.
              First off, tracking to see if someone is producive is incredibly difficult. An easy solution would be to just detect any input from the computer.
              But that runs into issues if the focused work, is done on paper, like reading a book. If a user is truly focused on the book, they aren't on the computer.
              Another Idea that was brought up is for the program to detect the current website your on to see if its something you SHOULD be doing. But
              not even any school in America as far as im concerned has been able to solve this problem.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="mb-4">Q2: If it's honor system, can't I just cheat it???</h2>

            <p>
              YES!!!! You absolutley can cheat this system! The entire point is for YOU to see how much work you're actually focused for.
              My app is intended for people who are serious about...well...learning how they work. What I hope people realize when using my app
              is that 1) Wow I cannot focus for very long... and 2) Wow I actually do not as much producive work as I think I do. Realizing this is the first
              step to a better work lifestyle.
            </p>


            <h2 class="mb-4">Q3: Why are you so taus?</h2>

            <p>
              Thanks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">Q4: Why can I only login using google</h2>

            <p>
              God knows....
